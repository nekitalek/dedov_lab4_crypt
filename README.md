# Weyl pairing on EC
Calculating the weyl pairing on elleptic curves
Elliptic curves over Prime fields and a small degree of attachment $𝑘$ Weil pairing are selected using an integer parameterization of the trace of Frobenius endomorphism $𝑇$, $𝑝$ characteristics of the field, the number of points $𝑟 = 𝑝 + 1 – 𝑇$ and Frobenius discriminant $𝐷𝜋 = T^2 -4$ The invariant of an elliptic curve is the root modulo $p$ of a polynomial defining a class field for an imaginary quadratic order $𝑂_𝐷$. 
When generating the curve parameters, formulas were used to obtain a small degree of embedding $k=4$. For this degree:
$$T = -1+6z, p = 12z^2 + 1, r = 12z^2-6z+1, D_π = -12z^2-12z+5$$
